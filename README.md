# Fatass Harveys life support machine

this is uh this shits for my stupid cats auto feeder. i chose to make it myself instead of an off the shelf cause he pukes if he eats to much at once so i need it to do small portions thorughout the day and also it needs to insult him because hes fat and no body likes him. I just started learning python so this is built on an esp32 with micropython. 

Shit works. Ill update read me one day 12 years from ow when i sober up
